## <a name="git_intro">Git and GitHub Intro</a>

:memo: During the course **"Version Control with Git"** and **"try.github.io"** I learned several new commands that I didn't know before and also found new tips to help me in the future.

##  <a name="linux_cli_http">Linux CLI, and HTTP</a>

:memo: __Linux Survival__ - definitely pumped up my knowledge on the command line (ls, cs, mkdir, kill, ps, aux) to the next level (mv, pwd, cp, rm, rmdir, find, df, lpr, lpq, lprm, cat), but I certainly should practice it more :hammer: ! 

:memo: **HTTP articles** - extended my knowledge (200, 400 & POST, GET) around status codes as well as verbs. I also discovered more about https and ssl certificates. But, there is no doubt, that I should extra study in order to understand HTTP caching and authentication.

## <a name="git_collaboration">Git Collaboration</a>

:memo: The **"GitHub & Collaboration"** course has certainly improved my understanding of working with forked repositories and , this knowledge will surely be useful in teamwork on the project! I also became more familiar with the CONTRIBUTING.md files.

## <a name="html_css_intro">Intro to HTML and CSS</a>

:memo: The **"Intro to HTML and CSS"** course from "udacity" was too easy-peasy task, which I handled very rapidly.

:memo: The **"Learn HTML"** course from "codecademy" was another really easy-breezy task that I did very quickly, despite the fact that I bought "pro" account which allowed me to cover every topic.

:memo: The **"Learn CSS"** course from "codecademy" was one more pretty lightweight task that I did quite quickly. Frankly speaking, there was a theme that made me refresh my knowledge and remember everything I had learned before, it was - Grid. So I should do more research :mag: and practice on this topic.

## <a name="responsive_web_design">Responsive Web Design</a>

:memo: The **"Responsive Web Design Fundamentals"** course from "udacity" showed me the result of interesting research :bulb: , which I will certainly use in the future :pushpin: , in particular that the average number of characters per line should be about 65, so that people do not skimming text. But other than that, it just refreshed my knowledge about breakpoints and @media :thumbsup:

## <a name="html_css_practice">HTML & CSS Practice</a>

:memo: Well, **HTML & CSS Practice** was really awesome task in order to complete which I had to make a pop-up menu using only **pure HTML and CSS**, without JS or any other libraries. It was a great practice that definitely made my brain get tense.

## <a name="javascript_basics">JavaScript Basics</a>

:memo: The **Intro to JavaScript** course from "udacity" wasn't something new to me, but nevertheless it gave me the possibility to recall and repeat the fundamental knowledge of JS such as data types & variables, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays and objects as well.

:memo: Well, I will be frank, **freecodecamp**  was not so simple for me as I first thought, its passage took me a couple of days. I had to look at the hint and google in order to come up with the idea of solving problems (especially in the algorithms challenges). There are also several new topics for me, such as recursion or currying, for which I really should do more research and practice in future!

:exclamation::exclamation: While passing one of the challenges, I even managed to find **a bug** :beetle: in the description of the test suites of the task. After that I successfully opened new [issue](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/40067) in the project repository, and I believe that fixing this bug will improve understanding :point_up: of the task.

## <a name="document_object_model">Document Object Model</a>

:memo: The **JavaScript and the DOM** course material from "udacity" was quite well-known to me, but I still highlighted a number of new JS features I didn't know, and took a deeper look at the call stack logic ! The new features I found were cssText; performance.now(); createDocumentFragment();

:memo: So, one more part of the algorithms from **freecodecamp** was successfully completed. Again, I had to look at the hint and Google :mag:. To be honest, building the logic of an app is not about creating pop-ups or so :)

:memo: Well, I wouldn't say that **DOM API**  was a difficult task until I started optimizing :twisted_rightwards_arrows: and improving :repeat_one: the code following mentors' recommendations. I think it really gave me a proper understanding of the approach to write ‚å®Ô∏è eligible code, gratitude a lot! :handshake:

## <a name="tiny_js_world">Building a Tiny JS World</a>

üìù When I was performing this task, I have faced up with several approaches that I could use to handle this project. For instance: 
```
const a = {a:a, b:b}, 
      b = {a:a, b:b}, 
      c = {a:a, b:b};
```
```
const arr = [a, b, c];
for(let el of arr) {
    let smth = `bla ${el.a}, bla ${el.b} bla, ${el.c} bla`;
    print(smth, 'div');
} 
```
```
cosnt arr = [a, b, c];
const someFunc = () => {
    let smth = '';
        for(let el of arr) {
            smth += `bla ${el.a}, bla ${el.b} bla, ${el.c} bla`;
        } 
    return smth;
};
const anotherFunc = () => {
    print(someFunc(), 'div'));
}
anotherFunc();
```
```
cosnt arr = new Array(a, b, c);
const someFunc = (el) => {
    return `bla ${el.a}, bla ${el.b} bla, ${el.c} bla`;
};
arr.forEach(el => print(someFunc(el), 'div'));
```
```
const someFunc = (el) => {
    return bla ${el.a}, bla ${el.b} bla, ${el.c} bla`;
};
Array.from([a, b, c], el => print(someFunc(el), 'div'));
```
```
cosnt arr = [a, b, c];
const someFunc = (el) => {
    return `bla ${el.a}, bla ${el.b} bla, ${el.c} bla`;
};
arr.map(el => print(someFunc(el), 'div'));
```
üìù Sure, there are also other tools to perform this assignment, which are faster, shorter, and so on, but my final solving was the last one on this list :arrow_heading_up:. I enjoy programming cause it's a sort of artistic  creativity :art:, and I like that there is no only :heavy_exclamation_mark:**ONE** solution, so you can be really flexible and versatile, unless, of course, there are strict documentation or some specific company approaches!
**p.s.** the main idea of this project`s solutions is that you aren't familiar with OPP approaches...
