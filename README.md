During the course **"Version Control with Git"** and **"try.github.io"** I learned several new commands that I didn't know before and also found new tips to help me in the future.

__Linux Survival__ - definitely pumped up my knowledge on the command line (ls, cs, mkdir, kill, ps, aux) to the next level (mv, pwd, cp, rm, rmdir, find, df, lpr, lpq, lprm, cat), but I certainly should practice it more! 

**HTTP articles** - extended my knowledge (200, 400 & POST, GET) around status codes as well as verbs. I also discovered more about https and ssl certificates. But, there is no doubt, that I should extra study in order to understand HTTP caching and authentication.  

## <a name="git_collaboration">Git Collaboration</a>

The **"GitHub & Collaboration"** course has certainly improved my understanding of working with forked repositories and , this knowledge will surely be useful in teamwork on the project! I also became more familiar with the CONTRIBUTING.md files.
