<strong>Linux Survival</strong> - definitely pumped up my knowledge on the command line (ls, cs, mkdir, kill, ps, aux) to the next level (mv, pwd, cp, rm, rmdir, find, df, lpr, lpq, lprm, cat), but I certainly should practice it more! 

<strong>HTTP</strong> articles - extended my knowledge (200, 400 & POST, GET) around status codes as well as verbs. I also discovered more about https and ssl certificates. But, there is no doubt, that I should extra study in order to understand HTTP caching and authentication.
