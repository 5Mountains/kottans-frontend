## <a name="git_intro">Git and GitHub Intro</a>

![git and gitHub intro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29441499/95737940-1cecbc00-0c91-11eb-9d58-2872280c8d4a.jpg)

During the course **"Version Control with Git"** and **"try.github.io"** I learned several new commands that I didn't know before and also found new tips to help me in the future.

##  <a name="linux_cli_http">Linux CLI, and HTTP</a>

![linux survival](task_linux_cli/linux_survival.gif)

__Linux Survival__ - definitely pumped up my knowledge on the command line (ls, cs, mkdir, kill, ps, aux) to the next level (mv, pwd, cp, rm, rmdir, find, df, lpr, lpq, lprm, cat), but I certainly should practice it more :hammer: ! 

**HTTP articles** - extended my knowledge (200, 400 & POST, GET) around status codes as well as verbs. I also discovered more about https and ssl certificates. But, there is no doubt, that I should extra study in order to understand HTTP caching and authentication.  

## <a name="git_collaboration">Git Collaboration</a>

![git collaboration](task_git_collaboration/github_collaboration.jpg)

The **"GitHub & Collaboration"** course has certainly improved my understanding of working with forked repositories and , this knowledge will surely be useful in teamwork on the project! I also became more familiar with the CONTRIBUTING.md files.

## <a name="html_css_intro">Intro to HTML and CSS</a>

![intro to html and css](task_html_css_intro/intro_html_and_css.jpg)

The **"Intro to HTML and CSS"** course from "udacity" was too easy-peasy task, which I handled very rapidly.

![intro to html and css](task_html_css_intro/html.gif)

The **"Learn HTML"** course from "codecademy" was another really easy-breezy task that I did very quickly, despite the fact that I bought "pro" account which allowed me to cover every topic.

![intro to html and css](task_html_css_intro/css.gif)

The **"Learn CSS"** course from "codecademy" was one more pretty lightweight task that I did quite quickly. Frankly speaking, there was a theme that made me refresh my knowledge and remember everything I had learned before, it was - Grid. So I should do more research :mag: and practice on this topic.

## <a name="responsive_web_design">Responsive Web Design</a>

![responsive web design fundamental](task_responsive_web_design/responsive-web_design_fundamental.jpg)

The **"Responsive Web Design Fundamentals"** course from "udacity" showed me the result of interesting research :bulb: , which I will certainly use in the future :pushpin: , in particular that the average number of characters per line should be about 65, so that people do not skimming text. But other than that, it just refreshed my knowledge about breakpoints and @media :thumbsup:

![flexbox froggy](task_responsive_web_design/frog.gif)

The **"Flexbox Froggy"** is "crash course" game which help me to practice CSS Flexbox, was easy task, which I managed pretty fast.

![grid garden](task_responsive_web_design/garden.gif)

The **"Grid Garden"** is another "crash course" game which help me to practice CSS Grid, was one more quite easy task, even though last lvls were challenging.

## <a name="html_css_practice">HTML & CSS Practice</a>

Well, HTML & CSS Practice was really awesome task in order to complete which I had to make a pop-up menu using only pure HTML and CSS, without JS or any other libraries. It was a great practice that definitely made my brain get tense.
