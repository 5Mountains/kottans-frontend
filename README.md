## <a name="git_intro">Git and GitHub Intro</a>

During the course **"Version Control with Git"** and **"try.github.io"** I learned several new commands that I didn't know before and also found new tips to help me in the future.

##  <a name="linux_cli_http">Linux CLI, and HTTP</a>

__Linux Survival__ - definitely pumped up my knowledge on the command line (ls, cs, mkdir, kill, ps, aux) to the next level (mv, pwd, cp, rm, rmdir, find, df, lpr, lpq, lprm, cat), but I certainly should practice it more! 

**HTTP articles** - extended my knowledge (200, 400 & POST, GET) around status codes as well as verbs. I also discovered more about https and ssl certificates. But, there is no doubt, that I should extra study in order to understand HTTP caching and authentication.  

## <a name="git_collaboration">Git Collaboration</a>

The **"GitHub & Collaboration"** course has certainly improved my understanding of working with forked repositories and , this knowledge will surely be useful in teamwork on the project! I also became more familiar with the CONTRIBUTING.md files.

## <a name="html_css_intro">Intro to HTML and CSS</a>

![intro to html and css](task_html_css_intro/intro_html_and_css.jpg)

The **"Intro to HTML and CSS"** course from "udacity" was too easy-peasy task, which I handled very rapidly.

The **"Learn HTML"** course from "codecademy" was another really easy-breezy task that I did very quickly, despite the fact that I bought "pro" account which allowed me to cover every topic.

The **"Learn CSS"** course from "codecademy" was one more pretty lightweight task that I did quite quickly. Frankly speaking, there was a theme that made me refresh my knowledge and remember everything I had learned before, it was - Grid. So I should do more research and practice on this topic.
